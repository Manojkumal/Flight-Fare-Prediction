# Project: Flight Fare Prediction
## Overview
This is the regression problem project. The model is trained by using machine learning algorithm. The trained model takes the different values as input and predict the prices of the flights.
### Motivation

Using machine learning approach, the model can easily to predict how much you need to spent on your flight expenses.

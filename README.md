# **Project: Flight Fare Prediction**

# **Overview**
This is the regression problem project. The model is trained by using machine learning algorithm. The trained model takes the different values as input and predict the prices of the flights.

# **Motivation**
Predicting flight prices without having proper idea about particular airline company is near too impossible. Using machine learning approach, the model can easily to predict how much you need to spent on your flight expenses. Uers can able to select one airline commpany base on budget for their ongoing journey through various airline commpanies and you didn't need to do any extra spent.
